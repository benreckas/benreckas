          <p>
            I'm a senior software engineer and team lead at AuditBoard working
            remotely in Friant, California. We make software for audit, risk,
            and compliance professionals for some of the largest companies in
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not programming, my wife and I are trying to keep up with
            our two daughters. I enjoy making things-- it doesn’t matter if it’s
            code, cocktails, or a coffee table.
          </p>
